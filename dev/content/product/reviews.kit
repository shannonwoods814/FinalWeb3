    <h3>Review by MegBrit. Written a year ago. <br>
        Let me start off by saying the Shark HyperAir Blow Dryer is better than I could’ve imagined! My hair is very thick and usually takes me at least 15 minutes to blow dry, while still leaving the underneath a bit damp. The Shark not only had my hair completely dry in 7 minutes and that includes the time that I fiddled with the attachments. Yep! It comes with two attachments, one that does a blowout—which added so much volume to my hair. I love how quiet this blow dryer is too. I can even blow dry my hair in the morning while my husband sleeps. I’m blown away by the quality of this blow dryer. Couldn’t be happier!

        <h3>Review by Nicole. Written a year ago. <br> 
            I’ve had it for about a week and I’m very disappointed. It dries like any other blow dryer, the attachments are huge and clunky and honestly don’t do anything to help. For the money it costs I would have expected so much more.
